          >(/ˈɑːbdəl kəˈlɑːm/ (About this soundlisten); 15 October 1931 – 27
          July 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist who served as the 11th
          president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in
          Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering.
          He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science
          administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development
          Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and
          was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and
          military missile development efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as
          the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic
          missile and launch vehicle technology.[2][3][4] He also played a
          pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's
          Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear
          test by India in 1974.
